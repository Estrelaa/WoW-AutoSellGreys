# WoW-AutoSellGreys
Wow addon that automatically sells grey items in your bag when interacting with a vender. It will automatically repair your gear, using your personal wealth.

Why did I make this when tons of addons like this exist? I was too lazy to go to curseforge and find one of them, so heres another one.

To install, Download via the code button, then move the "AutoSellGreys" folder to your wow/_retail_\Interface\AddOns folder
